OSC bridge for Thalmic Myo gesture control armband for Windows and Mac OS X 10.8+.

By [Samy Kamkar](http://samy.pl)

Myo-OSC is a C++ application designed to take hand gestures, accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data from the [Thalmic Labs Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) armband and output it over OSC. This allows incredible control of virtually any device or application just by waving or flailing your arm or hand around like a madman.

Binaries for both Windows and OS X are included in the root directory (myo-osc.win.exe / myo-osc.osx.bin).

I've built this and integrated it to control various things in my house and car using Raspberry Pi and Arduinos, including lights (over RF), TV (over IR), receiver (over IR), iTunes, coffee machine (over BLE), music in my car (over BLE), presentations (over IR), and Ableton/music production/DJing/VJing (over MIDI and OSC).

You can also send any OSC data over a network.

## Troubleshooting
On OS X, if you receiver an error message when running the trainer (LSOpenURLsWithRole() failed with error -10810), run this from Terminal:

chmod +x myo-trainer.app/Contents/MacOS/myo-trainer

Then rerun the trainer.

## Download
You can acquire Myo-OSC from github (redirects to latest branch): <http://samy.pl/myo-osc/>

------

## Usage
$ ./myo-osc [IP address (default: 127.0.0.1)] [OSC port (default: 7777)]

This will output the following OSC data

```
/myo/pose s MAC s pose

/myo/accel s MAC f X_vector3 f Y_vector3 f Z_vector3

/myo/gyro s MAC f X_vector3 f Y_vector3 f Z_vector3

/myo/orientation s MAC f X_quaternion f Y_quaternion f Z_quaternion f W_quaternion f roll f pitch f yaw
```

*Note:* Thalmic removed the unique MAC address in one of the alpha/beta versions of the SDK, so now the MAC will always return 00:00:00:00:00:00. Hoping this changes in a future version, or perhaps I can access the BLE stack directly and grab the MAC as it's publicly available.

Examples:

```
/myo/pose s f2-e0-66-5d-90-8a s fist

/myo/accel s f2-e0-66-5d-90-8a f 0.95849609375 f 0.26953125 f 0.20068359375

/myo/gyro s f2-e0-66-5d-90-8a f -7.14111280441284 f -15.8081045150757 f 5.43212842941284

/myo/orientation s f2-e0-66-5d-90-8a f -0.00215625390410423 f 3.37712929902281e-43 f -0.0021759606897831 f 0 f 0.928672909736633 f -1.23411226272583 f 1.45198452472687
